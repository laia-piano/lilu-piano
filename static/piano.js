Since 1923 in New York, the producers of Steinway's Grand Piano has renamed Model O to Model L, it wasn't until 2006 when they decided to revert its name to Model O, hence, the sole difference between these 2 models is simply their names. The reason behind the change between 1923 to 2005 was to cater to the American way of calling the 6 Foot Grand Piano.<br><br> The sound board of this piano is perfect and there is almonst no wear and tear inside the action. No need for renovation, only the appearance was fixed."

Due to high manufacturing costs and dwindling stocks of old wood after 1997, along with Japan's economic downturn, 米 back production ceased. Although the UX series was first released in 1975, the first four generations before 1990 featured a three-pillar crossing and were not 米, with significant differences in manufacturing processes, design, and material configuration compared to the later two generations.

It features an American walnut solid wood outer shell, with a soundboard made from 200-year-old Hokkaido fish-scale pine that has been naturally air-dried for 20 years. The middle pedal is a grand piano selective sustain pedal, and the soft pedal is controlled by a hand lever. It is equipped with top-quality W-grade rosewood hammers, and the bass and mid-range areas feature individual string supports like a grand piano, while the treble and upper mid-range have thicker, reinforced pressure bars. <br><br>This model, with all the top configurations and craftsmanship of Yamaha Japan, is a rare gem. The rice-back design was only produced between 1990 and 1997. Its tone completely surpasses the classic Yamaha U series."

        "description": "Launched in 1995, the Yamaha A1 is the smallest grand piano ever made in Japan by Yamaha, measuring only 149 cm in length. It was developed to meet the needs of customers who admired the C1 model but had limited living space and did not want the feel of an upright piano. As a result, the A1 was introduced as a more compact alternative to the C1, offering the same level of performance in a smaller footprint — a perfect solution for high-quality grand piano experience in small apartments. <br><br>In 2010, Yamaha discontinued the A1 due to its production costs being nearly identical to the C1, which began to affect the sales of both the C1 and the GC1. Since then, Yamaha has replaced its compact grand offerings with the more cost-effective GB1 and GN1 models, manufactured in Indonesia with lower-grade materials."
